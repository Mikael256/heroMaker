## what is hero Maker?
Hero Maker is a super easy to use hero screen maker for your web pages.

## How to
1. join jquery plugin in your html just before </body>
example:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

2. Add just after <script type="text/javascript" src="js/heroMaker.min.js"></script> (make sure your heroMaker.min.js is in the js folder of your website or change your src attribute accordingly.
